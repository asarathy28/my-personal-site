      <h1>Brownies & Whiskey</h1>

      <p><em>Easing her suffering with a false love was my greatest injustice to her. I was nothing more than a coward for my sins, guilt veiled as affection and pity disguised as sympathy.</em></p>

      <p>She walked a few paces ahead of me, in the grey evening light. The streets were still wet with puddles from the morning rain and she made no effort to avoid them. Her black boots, weathered and beaten, no longer seemed to bite into her unprotected skin but the irritation from weeks of neglect was apparent. A dull scar ran across her achilles where the shoe met flesh. Even apart from the boots, her appearance was still quite queer for the muggy summer evening. Her yellow-brown knit sweater was so baggy that it completely covered her hands as well as the jean shorts she was wearing. She held the end of her sleeves tightly in her fists; over her shoulder she carried a peculiar tote bag that was bulging at odd angles and giving off the faint scent of chocolate. It’s not that it was unusual for her to be so— unusual but something definitely seemed off. Her eyes were evasive and her typical aloof mannerisms were more distracted than spacey. Yet, she maintained her customary fasade of irradiance.</p>

      <p>She sat us down in the middle of a walking bridge. The creek flowing softly below us was only at most waist deep but the drop from the bridge was a solid 20 feet. The walk there wasn’t particularly short from my house and by the time we had arrived, my knock-off vans were soaked through the canvas. My true discomfort was not in my wet feet but instead, resided in knots of my stomach and lump in my throat. Why were we here? Why did she bring me of all people? If anything, I had always been terrible to her. I barely reserved the right to call her my friend for all the cruel things I’ve said and done. The shame came over me like the ocean crashing down during a tsunami. It's exactly for all that unkindness and abuse, I sit here.</p>

      <p>Slowly emptying her bag, she neatly placed one item at a time onto the wooden panels of the bridge. First they were just ordinary miscellaneous objects that you might find in a thirteen-year old girl’s bag: a few pencils and pens, a brand new tube of chapstick, tampons, and a broken pair of scissors. What was not normal to find in a thirteen-year old girl’s bag was a bottle of Glen Moray Scotch whiskey and a batch of freshly baked brownies still in the glass baking sheet.</p>

      <p>“You know, I didn’t even have to try to be sneaky. I walked into the kitchen and right in front of my dad, took the bottle from his cabinet. He didn’t look away from the TV once.”</p>

      <p>She pulled the cork from the bottle and lightly inhaled the aroma. She neither grimaced nor smiled and offered the bottle in my direction, holding her sleeve in her hand. I instinctively shook my head in alarm at the sudden appearance of alcohol. Its illicit stench burned my young nose even from that distance, forcing me to play off a reflexive gag as an ill timed cough. She placed the bottle down again, the cork next to it, and offered me a brownie. I gingerly took one from the pan as she held her own in her palm. They were slightly smushed from the jostling of her bag but otherwise looked appetizing enough. Together, we ate in silence, listening to the gentle rush of the creek and the soft munching of our treats. A moment of calm amid a storm. Her deep brown eyes steadied as she examined the brownies, as if its chocolatey gooey existence was giving reassurance to her next words.</p>

      <p>“These I made as a special sacrifice for the creek spirit. You see, they appreciate the compassion of freshly baked brownies even if they don’t need to eat.”</p>

      <p>Her tone was so nonchalant that for a second I accepted her ludicrous statement without question. Not waiting for a response, she got up in one fluid motion, picking up the remaining brownies with her. Just as swiftly, she dropped the glass pan over the side of the bridge; A piercing crack followed as the glass shattered among the rocks. While her words had been calm and measured, it had become painfully obvious by her erratic behavior that she was not okay, that she was numb, lost to herself. Yet, I couldn’t find the voice to comfort her.</p>

      <p>I stared mutely as she bent over to grab the bottle of whiskey. This time her sleeve slid back in her haste, revealing an array of dull lines, not unlike the ones on her ankles, running long and thin across her wrist. Further up her arm, I could glimpse a more brilliant set of crimson lines. A wave of nausea passed over me, worse than if I had been steeping in a tub full of that vile smelling drink. These lines were raw and ugly strokes not as easy to dismiss. They twisted and turned over her arm, carving the letters into my mind: H E L P M E. Except those strokes were not for me to see, or for anyone to see. They were her muffled cries, locked and chained by her numbing despair. As the liquor poured out of the bottle in a single thin stream, I understood that she didn’t bring me with her hoping for empathy. To her, I’m no different than that pair of broken scissors in her bag, used to draw that dazzling pain out of her viens where she can see it, feel it; Because something is better than nothing.</p>

      <p>The bottle dropped to the creek with another crack. She turned to face me, our eyes meeting for the first time that evening. Her eyes lingered, searching for the words that wouldn’t leave my lips. I dropped her gaze, unwilling to show her the cruelty that she expects of me. Disconcerted, she scooped up her remaining belongings and rose to her feet, meaning to leave me alone on that bridge. But at the tug of my hand, grasped firmly around hers, she stopped and looked back, the faintest of smiles fluttering across her face.</p>

      <p>“Wait— I’ll walk home with you.”</p>
